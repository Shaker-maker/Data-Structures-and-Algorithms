# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms


Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms** journey! ðŸš€

## Description
This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems as I learn and practice them using **Python**. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and build a solid foundation in computer science concepts.

## Why This Repository?
- To track my progress as I learn DSA from scratch.
- To build consistency by solving problems regularly.
- To showcase my problem-solving skills to future employers.
- To help others who might be learning DSA as well.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
